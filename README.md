# GameTracker
Basic app that was used to learn more about SwiftUI and Combine.

Current version allows you to login via Steam, see the last 3 games you played and your achievment progress on those games. You can also view all the games you own on steam as well.

If you want to try this app you will need to add a steam `key` in the `SteamFetcher` class which can be done [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and a Twitch Dev `clientId` and `clientSecret` in the `IGDBFetcher`class which can be made by following [this tutorial](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication#registration).

Might add in more functionality later but for now this is all the app can do.
